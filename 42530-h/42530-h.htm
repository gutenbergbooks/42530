<p>There is, of course, to be an Eisteddfod in 1896; and it appears
that the Llandudno Executive Committee have been making some
revolutionary proposals with reference to it. They have resolved
that they "respectfully desire that the Gorsedd will see its way to
concur in the subject for the chair
being in any metre, and not restricted
to an awdl. The Committee
are aware that the awdl has antiquity
and custom in its favour, but,
while calculated to develop skill in
metrical composition, the local Committee
feel that the necessity of
composing in the form of an awdl
is fettering to the conception and
imagination." I cannot say what
an awdl is, but I am dead against
fetters, and, therefore, I say, down
with the dastardly, fettering awdl.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<div class="poem width24">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Swift, strike off the fetters, wherever they're found,</p>
<p>Let the song-loving Welshman go free and unbound.</p>
<p>To the awdl too long has he bended his knee,</p>
<p>But its fate has been sealed, and the Welshman is free;</p>
<p>As free as his ocean, as free as his breezes,</p>
<p>He shall write as he likes, in what metre he pleases;</p>
<p>And he faces his Gorsedd, and vows he won't dawdle</p>
<p>A manacled slave in the train of the awdl.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<hr class="short" />

<p>After this it seems somewhat bald and prosaic to read that</p>

<blockquote><p>
On the recommendation of "Hwfa Mon" (the Archdruid), "Eifionydd"
(the registrar), "Cadvan," "Pedrog," "Gwynedd," and "Dyfed," of the
Gorsedd Committee, who stated that the subject chosen for the arwrgerdd
(heroic poem), for which a prize of £20 and a silver crown is offered, was unsuitable
for an arwrgerdd, the subject was changed, "Llewelyn Fawr" being
substituted for "St. Tudno."&mdash;Instead of the galar-gan, the subject of which
was "Clwydfardd," for which £15 was the prize, it was decided to offer a
prize of £15 and a gold medal for the best awdl on "Clwydfardd," the
Gorsedd stating that an awdl would be much more appropriate, as the late
Archdruid was a great admirer of the twenty-four metres. Instead of the hir
a thoddaid "Cestyll Cymru" (Castles of Wales) it was decided to offer a
prize of £2 2<i>s.</i> for the best hir a thoddaid "Beddargraph 'Elis Wyn o
Wyrfai,'" and also £2 2<i>s.</i> for the best hir a thoddaid "Beddargraph 'Tudno.'"
</p></blockquote>

<p>The Bishop of <span class="sc">Hereford</span> has requested the parishes in his diocese
to send up petitions respecting the Armenian atrocities. One of these
parishes is Walford-on-Wye, and I propose to confer immortality
upon the reply sent by its Vicar to the Bishop.</p>

<blockquote><p>
"I regret" (says this truly <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Original reads 'Christain'">Christian</ins> cleric) "having been unable to respond
in the way you desired to your appeal respecting the persecution of
Christians in Armenia. My not doing so was owing to the circumstance
that at the present time a remonstrance from our nation can have no moral
weight whatever. We have now in office a Government which is exercising
all its ingenuity in plans for the persecution and plunder of Christians here,
and so long as we tolerate the continuance of such a Government in office the
Turk would be justified in telling us to reform this scandal before we presume
to remonstrate with him."
</p></blockquote>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In other words, the Vicar of Walford-on-Wye disapproves of the
Welsh Church Disestablishment Bill, and refuses on that account to
join in a protest against the torture and murder of his Armenian
fellow-creatures. The logic of the Vicar is as convincing as his
Christian sympathy is admirable. Let him be known henceforth as
the Vicar of Reason Wye.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>What on earth is a "Rational Sick and Burial Association?"
They possess one at Acton Turville; and, only the other day, it held
great junketings. I may possibly have been rationally sick, but I
have certainly never yet been rationally, or even irrationally, buried,
nor, I take it, have the very vigorous members of the Association.
However, they had a procession, which started from the club-room,
headed by the Malmesbury band, and then walked to Badminton,
calling at the Duke of <span class="sc">Beaufort's</span>, where they were all treated with
refreshments. Imagine his sporting Grace's feelings at being called
upon to treat with refreshments a procession of the rationally sick
and buried. They then dined. The <em>menu</em> is not given, but no doubt
included bread made from mummy-wheat, Dead-sea fruit, and
copious libations of bier (spelling again!).</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Close to Bristol, too, there is a place rejoicing in the name of
Fishponds, where, at the Full Moon Hotel, the Loyal Pride of Fishponds
Lodge of the Bristol Equalised District of the Order of Druids
meets for its various celebrations. The members sometimes "perambulate
the village, headed by the band of the Mangotsfield detachment
of the Bristol Rifles."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<div class="poem width27">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Now strike the clashing cymbals, and sound the big bassoon,</p>
<p>The Loyal Pride of Fishponds Lodge has left the old "Full Moon,"</p>
<p>Yet, though their band be warlike, they mean nor war nor pillage,</p>
<p>'Tis charity that bids them thus perambulate the village.</p>
<p>No member of the Order would dare to come too late</p>
<p>When Fishponds calls her Druids out to celebrate a <em>fête</em>.</p>
<p>Then, while with martial music, the left foot on the beat,</p>
<p>The Lodge awakes the echoes loud in every village street,</p>
<p>The villagers of Fishponds forsake their early bed,</p>
<p>And each one at his window displays a nightcapped head,</p>
<p>Salutes the hoary Druids, nor fails to greet with cheers,</p>
<p>The Mangotsfield detachment of Bristol Volunteers.</p>

<p>A Correspondent writes to the <cite>Scotsman</cite>, protesting against the
omission of the grey plover from the list of birds to be protected
under the Wild Birds Protection Act. "That the eggs," he adds,
"are gathered by keepers and others for sale, should certainly be no
argument; and any keeper might well be ashamed to watch a poor
harmless bird all day through binoculars for the purpose of making
a few shillings by the sale of its eggs." We live and learn. I have
been eating plover's eggs for years without the least suspicion that
the poor harmless mother-bird had been shamefully watched through
binoculars by a keeper in search of shillings. All the same. I
heartily indorse the suggestion that the plover should be protected.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sir Donald Currie</span> must have the eye of an eagle. Speaking at
a luncheon held in Newcastle the other day in connection with the
Trinity Presbyterian Church, he declared that "nothing had ever
charmed him more than to observe at the luncheon that day the
marvellous ability, but much more the marvellous unanimity and
Christian fellowship manifested by the Nonconformist bodies." I
doff my cap to the man who can infer not only marvellous unanimity
and Christian fellowship, but also marvellous ability from his observation
of bodies at luncheon. After this it must be the merest
child's-play to navigate the <em>Tantallon Castle</em> to the Baltic Canal.</p>

<p>At a recent meeting of the Blackrock Town Commissioners, so I
gather from the <cite>Freeman's Journal</cite>, Dr. <span class="sc">Kough</span>, the Vice-Chairman,
objected to the adoption of a petition in favour of the Intoxicating
Liquors (Ireland) Bill. He said the petition had been carried by a
side-wind. Obviously, in the Doctor's opinion, the only thing to be
done was to Kough-drop it.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Light and Heat; or, in a Concatenation accordingly.</span>&mdash;Speaking
of "the invisible parts of the solar spectrum," Dr.
<span class="sc">Huggins</span> tells us the "ultra-red" has been traced to a distance nearly
"ten times as long as the whole range of the visible or light-giving
region of the spectrum." Nature, indeed, is "all of a piece." In
politics, as in optics, the "Ultra-Red" lies beyond the "light-giving
region," though, as Science says of its "gamut of invisible
rays," they are perceived "by their heating effects." The S. D. F.'s
and other wavers of the Red Flag, should study up-to-date optics.</p>

<h2>SUN AND SONG.</h2>

<p><em>Saturday.</em>&mdash;Have just been reading in <cite>Temple Bar</cite> an article on
the influence of sunshine on <span class="sc">Shelley</span>, <span class="sc">Byron</span>, <span class="sc">Keats</span>,
<span class="sc">Moore</span>,
<span class="sc">Southey</span>, and other poets. Never thought of that before. There is
so little sunshine in London, and when there is one never sits out in
it. That is why all the magazines reject my sonnets, and why no
one will publish my tragedy in blank verse. Sunshine! Right on
the top of one's bare head. That is the cure. The reason is obvious&mdash;Ph&oelig;bus
Apollo, the Divine Afflatus, and all that sort of thing.
Must go somewhere into the sunshine at once. Brighton is near,
Brighton is shadeless, Brighton under the June sunshine is hot.
The very place. Shall now at last electrify the world. Go down by
an evening train. Somewhat crowded. Whitsuntide, of course.</p>

<p><em>Sunday.</em>&mdash;Glorious morning. Blaze of sunshine. Brighton is not
an inspiring place for a poet. Walk along asphalted parade. Extremely
hot. But that is just what I want. Still <span class="sc">Shelley</span> and the
others did not advocate softened asphalte, to which one's boots
almost stick. The beach is the right place. Lie down on the dusty
shingle above high water mark, take off my hat, and abandon myself
to the Divine Afflatus. Wait patiently for inspiration. Can only
think how hot it is. Wonder if the Divine Afflatus could get through
my hat. Put on my hat. Still no inspiration. Take my hat off
again. Begin to become insensible in the warmth. Suddenly feel
on the back of my head a sensation as of something striking me.
Can it be the inspiration? No, it was a pebble. Jump up. Boys
behind, aimlessly throwing stones, have hit me. Sudden inspiration
to rush after them with uplifted stick. Sudden flight of boys.
Pursue them over uneven shingle. Wonder if <span class="sc">Shelley</span> and the
others ever did that. At last stop, breathless, hotter than ever.
Find, with difficulty, another unoccupied space on beach, and lie
down again. Become quite drowsy. Suddenly wake up. Must have
been asleep for a long time. Sun going down. No inspiration yet,
and no chance of Divine Afflatus to-day. Must wait till to-morrow.
Head aching very much. Wonder if <span class="sc">Shelley</span> and the others had
headaches when the D. A. was coming on. Consult <cite>Temple Bar</cite>.
Apparently not. Very strange.</p>

<p><em>Monday.</em>&mdash;Again blazing sunshine. Hotter than ever. This must
bring on the D. A. if anything would. Again lie on beach. More
crowded than yesterday. Some of the people seem friendly, and to be
interested in my experiment, for they address me and advise me to
get my hair cut. Could this possibly be advantageous to admit the
D. A.? No. <span class="sc">Shelley</span> and the others wore their hair like mine, not
cropped like a convict's. Tell this to my new friends. They laugh.
I become angry. Then they tell me to keep my hair on. Curious
instance of the vacillation of popular opinion. They go away singing.
Pain in my head and sleepiness still worse. Can no longer
keep awake. Abandon myself to D. A. Am suddenly aroused by
someone shaking my arm. Open my eyes. Can hardly see anything.
Awful pain in head. Shut my eyes again. My arm again shaken
roughly. A voice says, "Now then, get up." Endeavour to lift my
head but cannot. Never felt so ill before. Murmur feebly, "I
can't. It's the D. A. coming on." Voice answers, "D. T. yer
mean. None o' your gammon. You come along o' me." Begin now
to understand that it is not Ph&oelig;bus Apollo who is standing by me in
a vision. It is not even a beautiful woman, as in <span class="sc">Shelley's</span>
<em>Alastor</em>.
It is a policeman. Must find precedent for this. Somehow my voice
seems changed and uncertain, but I manage to murmur, "<em>Temple
Bar</em>." "Oh yes," says the policeman, "you've been enough in the
bar. Now yer can try the dock. Come along." He endeavours to
raise me, but I again fall insensible.</p>

<p><em>Wednesday.</em>&mdash;Remember dimly the horrible events of the last
thirty-six hours. I was taken to the police-station, and brought
before the magistrate. He would not even look at <cite>Temple Bar</cite>, and
fined me for being drunk and incapable. I drunk and incapable!
Oh heavens! To-day I am back in London. The sky is cloudy. No
chance of the D. A. now. Shall give up poetry for ever, and for the
future write words for songs.</p>

<h2 class="sans">AT A YEOMANRY REVIEW.</h2>

<p class="ind"><span class="outdent"><span class="sc">Scene</span></span>&mdash;<i>An open space near Baymouth, the watering-place at which
the County Yeomanry have been going through their annual
training. Along one side of the ground is a row of drags and
other carriages, occupied by the local magnates; along another,
the less distinguished spectators stand in a thin line or occasional
groups, waiting for the review to begin. In the centre, the inspecting
officer is judging the best turned-out troop, while the
remainder of the regiment are doing nothing in particular.</i></p>

<p><em>Yeomanry Non-Com.</em> (<i>who is leading an officer's horse and talking
to a female friend of his and her brother with the sense of conferring
a distinction upon them</i>). Ah, 'tis not all play this yere
trainin', I do assure ye. I've been so 'ard-worked all the week,
with all the writin' I've had to do at the orderly room and thet, I've
'ardly 'ad time to <em>live!</em> But I like it, mind ye, I like it more every
year I come out and so does my old 'errse, a' b'lieve. And there's
this about it too&mdash;the girls don't
come errfter a feller!</p>

<p><em>The Young Lady.</em> Well, I'm
sure! Now <em>I</em> should have thought
when you're in the Yeomanry, it
was just what&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>The Y. N.-C.</em> Tain't so&mdash;not in
my case&mdash;that's all I can tell ye.</p>

<p><em>The Y. L.</em> (<i>with coquettish incredulity</i>).
Oh, I daresay. With
that uniform, too! Why, I expect,
if the truth was told, you know
more than one young lady who's
glad enough to be seen about with
you.</p>

<p><em>The Y. N.-C.</em> (<i>complacently</i>).
More than one! Why, theer wurr
eight I took out in a boat for a
moonlight row on'y lawst night&mdash;nawn
o' <em>my</em> seekin', but they
wouldn't take no denial. <em>I</em> didn't
want to be bothered with 'en. I've
got other things to do besides
squirin' a passel o' wimmin folk

[<i>He trots off, feeling that he has

<p><em>The Y. L.</em> (<i>to her brother, with

Distinctly "country," isn't he?</p>

<p><em>Her Brother.</em> Well, he can't

<p><em>The Y. L.</em> Oh, he's a real good

just a little &mdash;&mdash; I did hope I'd
polished him up a little while we were at the farm last summer;
but there, I suppose you <em>can't</em> put refinement into some people!</p>

<p><em>Another Young Lady</em> (<i>to her</i> Admirer). I can't make <span class="sc">George</span>
out yet among them all&mdash;can <em>you?</em></p>

<p><em>Her Admirer</em> (<em>and</em> <span class="sc">George's</span> <em>rival</em>). Cawn't say as
I've tried, partickler.
But there's one there in the rear rank that hes a look of
him; that one settin' all humped up nohow on his 'errse.</p>

<p><em>The Adored One.</em> Oh, of course, if you're going to make out as
<span class="sc">George</span> can't sit on a horse!</p>

<p><em>Her Admirer</em> (<i>sulkily</i>). Well, I'd back myself to ride 'cross
country agen <span class="sc">Garge</span> any day.</p>

<p><em>The Adored One.</em> Then why don't <em>you</em> join the Yeomanry, like
<em>he</em> has?</p>

<p><em>Her Admirer</em> (<i>who would if he could afford it</i>). Why? 'Cause
'taint worth my while, if you want to know!</p>

<p><em>The Adored One.</em> I'm sure it's a smart enough uniform&mdash;at least
<span class="sc">George</span> looks quite 'andsome in it.</p>

<p><em>Her Admirer.</em> He didn't look very 'andsome when I see him on
parade this marnin'; the sun had peeled his nose a treat!</p>

<p><em>The Adored One.</em> It's well there are <em>some</em> who are willing to make
sacrifices for their country!</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Among the Carriages.</span></h4>

<p><em>Mrs. Prattleton.</em> Yes, so <em>sad</em> for him, poor dear; but of course
whenever his father dies, he'll be <em>quite</em> comfortable. (<i>Recognising
a military acquaintance.</i>) Oh, Captain <span class="sc">Clinker</span>, do come and tell
me what they're supposed to be doing out there, and whether
they've begun yet.</p>

<p><em>Capt. Clinker</em> (<i>R.A.</i>). Nothin' much goin' on at present. Ah,
they seem to be wakin' up now a bit. (<i>As the band strikes up.</i>)
There's the general salute; now they're goin' to make a start.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Pratt.</em> Who is that little man in the baggy black frock,
rather like a dressing-gown, and the cocked hat; and why is he
galloping out here?</p>

<p><em>Capt. C.</em> He's the inspectin' officer; takin' up his position for the
march past, don't you know.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Pratt</em>. Oh; and they're all going to march past <em>him</em>. How
nice! But there's <em>another</em> officer in a cocked hat; is <em>he</em>
inspecting,
too?</p>

<p><em>Capt. C.</em> Only their tongues; he's the regimental Pill&mdash;the <em>doctor</em>,
you know.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Pratt.</em> (<i>disenchanted</i>). I quite thought he must be a general
at <em>least</em>. Dear me, there's one man in a red coat and a helmet.
What is <em>he</em> doing here?</p>

<p><em>Capt. C.</em> That's the adjutant.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Pratt</em>. Oh; and the adjutant
always wears a helmet. I <em>see</em>.
They've hung red silk round the
kettledrums; (<i>pleased</i>) that's <em>real</em>
soldiering, isn't it?</p>

<p><em>Officers</em> (<i>as the regiment marches
past by squadrons</i>). Right whe-eel!
Eyes right! For-ward! Dress up
to your leaders there!</p>

<p><em>Capt. C.</em> (<i>with languid approbation</i>).
The dressin's not half bad.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Pratt.</em> No, they're dressed
very like Hussars&mdash;or is it Artillery
I mean? I always had an idea the
Yeomanry wore <em>comic</em> uniforms&mdash;with
shirt-collars, you know, and
old-fashioned milk-pail hats with
feathers and things. But (<em>disappointedly</em>)
there's nothing ridiculous
about these. What a frisky
animal that trumpeter is riding;
look at him caracoling about!</p>

<p><em>Capt. C.</em> Trumpeters and serjeant-majors
always the best mounted.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Pratt.</em> Are they? I wonder
why <em>that</em> is. (<em>As the regiment
ranks by in single file.</em>) But they've
<em>all</em> got beautiful horses.</p>

<p><em>Capt. C.</em> (<i>critically</i>). H'm,
they're a fair-lookin' lot. Fall off
a bit behind, some of 'em.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Pratt.</em> Do they? Then they
can't be very good riders, <em>can</em> they?</p>

<p><em>Capt. C.</em> These fellows? They
ought to be; most of 'em, you see,
hunt their horses regularly.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Pratt.</em> (<i>with a mental vision
of dismounted troopers chasing their
chargers about the ground</i>). What
fun! I should like to see them
do that. (<i>As the regiment trots
past in sections.</i>) But they don't
seem to come off over the trotting.</p>

<p class="center">"'Twas onfortunate fur Garge, him bein' th' only man as fell arf."</p></div>

<p><em>Capt. C.</em> Not quite; the leaders don't keep their distance, so the
men can't keep up. Still, considering how short a time they've been
out, you can't expect&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Pratt.</em> No; and they haven't tried to <em>gallop</em> yet, have they?
Some of the horses are cantering now, though; it looks so much
nicer than if they all trotted, <em>I</em> think.</p>

<p><em>Capt. C.</em> Don't fancy their Colonel would agree with you there.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Pratt.</em> What a shame to keep those poor soldiers out there
all by themselves; they don't have any fun, and they only get in
the way of the others when they turn round. Oh, look at them
now&mdash;they're all coming straight at us, and waving their swords!</p>

<p><em>Capt. C.</em> Pursuin' practice at the gallop; doin' it rather decently,
too.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Pratt.</em> But <em>do</em> you think we're safe just here? Suppose
they can't stop themselves in time!</p>

<p><em>Capt. C.</em> No danger of that; too heavily bitted to get out of hand....
There, you see, they're all wheelin' round. That'll be the wind
up. Yes, they're drawn up in line; officers called to the front.
Now the inspecting officer is makin' a few remarks, butterin' 'em up
all round, you know. It's all over.</p>

<p><em>Mrs. Pratt.</em> Really? It's been a great success, hasn't it? I
enjoy a review so much better when they don't have any horrid
firing. Don't you?</p>

<p><em>Saturday.</em>&mdash;Production of <em>Harold</em>. New
Opera; music by <span class="sc">Cowen</span>, book by Sir <span class="sc">E.
Malet</span>, British Representative man in service
of Foreign Office, writing words for
diplomatic, and words for musical notes.
However good-tempered a composer may be,
yet when he wants to write an opera he
cannot get on without "having words."
No time left to give full criticism on <em>Harold</em>,
which achieved sufficient success to satisfy
composer and librettist; it may be as well to
state that there is nothing "old" in it, except
in last syllable of name. Years ago
favourite subject with artists was "the finding
of the body of <span class="sc">Harold</span>." Sir <span class="sc">Edward</span>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p>My Baronite, constitutionally credulous, on reading the earlier
works of <span class="sc">John Oliver Hobbes</span>, accepted the masculinity of the
author as put forward on the title page. On reading <cite>The Gods,
Some Mortals, and Lord Wickenham</cite> (<span class="sc">Henry &amp; Co.</span>), he begins to
doubt. No man, not the weakest-minded amongst us, habitually
uses italics in writing a book. Moreover, none but a woman could
draw such a creature as <em>Mrs. Anne Warre</em>. The more generous
masculine nature could not imagine anything so unrelievedly undesirable.
Doubtless she is made so bad the more strikingly to compare
with <em>Allegra</em>, "whose charm was the charm of springtime and love,
all the kind promises of the sunshine, the life, the tenderness, the
warmth, the graciousness of nature." The book, the most ambitious,
and, in point of length, the most important, that has come from the
pen of <span class="sc">John Oliver Hobbes</span>, is marked by her gift of keen observation,
that sees everything and sees through most people. Dialogue
and narrative sparkle with felicitous turns, bubble over with epigram.
There are boundless possibilities in <span class="sc">John Oliver Hobbes</span>; but she
should turn her face more persistently to the sunlight. <em>Dr. Warre</em>
and <em>Allegra</em> are so good and so pleasant, that the average reader
would like a little more of them, and a little less of the almost impossible
<em>Mrs. Warre</em>.</p>

<p>The proper study of mankind is man, and there could not be an
apter tutor than Mr. <span class="sc">Smalley</span>. His <cite>Studies of Men</cite>
(<span class="sc">Macmillan</span>),
have, as he tells us in a preface, appeared for the most part in the
<cite>New York Tribune</cite>. Everyone conversant with newspaper work
will know that for many years Mr. <span class="sc">Smalley's</span> Letter from London to
what, take it all in all, is the principal, certainly the weightiest,
journal in the United States, has been its most prominent feature.
A selection of these contributions have, happily, been rescued from
the files of the newspaper, and are here presented. The Studies cover
a wide range, but the subjects are all, in diverse fashion, interesting.
One is struck with the extreme fairness of judgment displayed in
dealing with men who stand so far apart as, for example, Mr. <span class="sc">Arthur
Balfour</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">Parnell</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">Spurgeon</span>, <span class="sc">Tennyson</span>,
Lord <span class="sc">Rosebery</span>,
Sir <span class="sc">William Harcourt</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">Froude</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">John Walter</span>,
and
Lord <span class="sc">Randolph Churchill</span>. During his long residence in England
Mr. <span class="sc">Smalley</span> has known these and others, personally and in their
public aspect. He has stored a picture gallery in which posterity
may see them as they lived, nothing extenuated nor anything
set down in malice. By way of redressing afresh the balance
between the Old World and the New, Mr. <span class="sc">Smalley</span> has turned his
back on London, and, having all these years written about
Europeans, for the edification of Transatlantic readers, is about to
tell Europe, in the columns of the <cite>Times</cite>, something of the undercurrent
of public affairs in the United States. He will find in
himself a most damaging rival.</p>

But how about the future of those who have to listen to it? He

containing untold gold "are your secret instructions."</p>

<p>"They shall be faithfully obeyed," replied the ever-faithful <span class="sc">Toby</span>;

drank the <span class="sc">Shahzada's</span> health most heartily. Then capital short
speech from Right Honourable <span class="sc">Fowler</span> about India. <span class="sc">Shahzada</span>
satisfied with dinner, gratified by reception. On deck the <span class="sc">Shahzada</span>
called <span class="sc">Toby</span> aside. Interpreter intervened. "<em>Detnaw ton!
Tuoteg!</em>" said the <span class="sc">Shahzada</span>, quietly, but authoritatively.</p>

<p>The interpreter retired, muttering to himself "Bow-strings for
one." "Look here," said the <span class="sc">Shahzada</span> to <span class="sc">Toby</span> ... and they
discussed
affairs (<span class="sc">Toby</span> acting as <em>Mr. P.'s</em> representative) of such
importance that they cannot be even hinted at in this or any other
place. "And now," said the <span class="sc">Shahzada</span>, still speaking in his
native language, of which this is a translation, "is it not true that
one of your national institutions at Greenwich is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Fair?"</p>

<p>"Bah!" laughed the <span class="sc">Shahzada</span>, "that has long since vanished;
so have the Pensioners at the Hospital. But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is still hospitality," murmured <span class="sc">Toby</span>, salaaming his very
best.</p>

<p>"There is," returned the <span class="sc">Shahzada</span>, "and <em>you</em> shall show it."</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, your Royal Highness?" asked <span class="sc">Toby</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Shahzada</span> drew him yet further apart from the envious
crowd, and whispered in his ear.</p>

<p>"Your Royal Highness," answered <span class="sc">Toby</span>, "it shall be done.
Command that the boat be stopped at Greenwich."</p>

<p>So the boat was stopped at Greenwich, and the <span class="sc">Shahzada</span>, with
<span class="sc">Toby</span>, debarked. Great cheering.</p>

<h3>RATHER A HANDFUL!</h3>

<p>There seems to be a feeling among lady
writers that they also should have been
remembered in the Birthday-honour distribution.
That is all very well, but quite a new
demand has been started by the <cite>Cork Constitution</cite>,
which remarks,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"It would not of course be regular to bestow a
knighthood upon a lady; but the rule in the
case of Mrs. <span class="sc">Disraeli</span> might be observed, and
a Baroness be conferred upon the author of <cite>Lady
Audley's Secret</cite>."
</p></blockquote>

<p>What would <span class="sc">Miss Braddon</span> do with a Baroness
when she got her? Work her up into
her next plot? Peeresses must be "cheap
to-day," if they can be given away in this
generous style.</p>

account of "Speeches," at

"The speakers were attired

Oppidans worn "gowns,"
black or otherwise? Those
who used to wear gowns
were the Collegers. Surely
the custom, sanctioned by

<h2>THE GOOSE AND THE EAGLE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<em>A Fable.</em>)</p>

<p>A Goose that had miss-spent a long life,
and, in addition to being old and ugly, was of
a sour, ill-natured disposition, in despair of
rendering herself any longer agreeable to her
male acquaintances, conceived the desperate
design of emancipating her female friends.</p>

<p>"It is intolerable," she declared to a large
assemblage of the latter who flocked together
directly the news of her design was noised
abroad, "it is intolerable that, whilst all the
good things of this life are reserved for the
exclusive use and enjoyment of our male
tyrants, we poor female creatures should be
put off with feeble bodies and dowdy, unattractive
plumage. I will go immediately
to the King of Birds and demand the instant
redress of these grievances under pain of my
serious displeasure."</p>

<p>Scarcely had the Goose received the thanks
of her audience for this valiant speech, when
an Eagle, which chanced to be soaring at that
moment in the heavens above them, and was
attracted by the clamour that reached him,
dropped suddenly to the earth in order to discover
the cause of it; to whom the Goose, so
soon as she was sufficiently recovered of her
fears, humbly addressed her complaint.</p>

<p>"Foolish bird!" exclaimed the Eagle,
when the Goose had made an end of her complainings,
"know you not that what is fixed
by Nature cannot possibly be altered by birds;
and that if your sex have weaker bodies and
a less attractive plumage than belong to us of
the male gender, it is because Nature wills it
so, and must be obeyed? Learn to be content
with what you have, and cease envying those
to whom Nature has been more prodigal of
certain favours than she has been to you.
Remember, also, foolish bird! that strength
of mind is not the same thing with strength
of body, and that though you may possess the
one and pretend to despise the other, yet is
Might the foundation of nearly all Right in
the animal world, and must remain so because
Nature will have it so and must be obeyed."</p>

<p><em>Edwin.</em> Is that why he is sitting in a chair with his back to the
audience while <em>Marguerite</em> strokes his hair?</p>

<p><em>Ang.</em> Yes. While she is stroking his hair she is saying how fond
she is of him. And now he is telling her how fond he is of her.</p>

<p><em>Edwin</em> (<i>after a quarter of an hour</i>). What are they saying?</p>

<p><em>Ang.</em> Oh, just the same thing over and over again. The Italian
language is so beautiful. "Oh, <em>Armande</em>!" She calls him by his
Christian name. She is so attached to him.</p>

<p><em>Edwin.</em> But what was the meaning of that?</p>

<p><em>Ang.</em> (<i>at the end of the Act</i>). Oh, don't you see, he said something
that pleased her. Then she kissed him. Really, I had no idea how
easy Italian was. Of course, one understands it from knowing
French. (<i>Entr'acte passes as before, and curtain rises on Act Three.</i>)
Ah, here we are at Auteuil. Yes, and here comes <em>Marguerite</em> with
some flowers. Isn't it interesting?</p>

<p><em>Edwin.</em> Isn't this piece rather like the <em>Traviata</em>?</p>

<p><em>Ang.</em> I don't know. But I never saw the Opera. And there,
that old gentleman has come to call upon <em>Marguerite</em>.</p>

<p><em>Edwin.</em> Why, of course, like the old chap with the baritone song.
Now I begin to understand Italian myself.</p>

<p><em>Ang.</em> Do you, dear? Well, you see, he was going to be rude, and
then they made it up, and she gave him a chair. And there, do you
see? she leaves a letter for <em>Armande</em>. It is for him to read. And
now she leaves him. And he is reading the letter.</p>

<p><em>Edwin.</em> And doesn't seem to like it. And there's the old chap
(<em>without the song</em>), and he is consoling him.</p>

<p><em>Ang.</em> (<i>after a glance at her playbill</i>). Yes, because they are
father
and son. (<i>The Fourth Act passes, and she explains to her husband
that Marguerite has been playing at cards, and that Armande is
very angry with her.</i>) That's why he throws money at her.</p>

<p><em>Edwin.</em> Rather a cad&mdash;<em>Armande</em>.</p>

<p><em>Ang.</em> Oh, no. You know we must not judge foreigners by an
English standard. (<i>The last Act commences.</i>) You see, she is
very ill. That cradle covered with rugs is her bed.</p>

<p><em>Edwin.</em> Indeed!</p>

<p><em>Ang.</em> Yes. And that I suppose must be the doctor. I wonder
what they are saying! This Act they all seem to be talking faster
than they did in the others. That old woman was her friend. I
wonder why she has left her like that!</p>

<p><em>Edwin.</em> Didn't she say something like "What a rum go?" It is
the only line I have understood since the commencement of the
performance. What is she saying now?</p>

<p><em>Ang.</em> (<i>hesitating</i>). Well, I am not quite sure. But you see she is
very ill. She scarcely recognises <em>Armande</em>.</p>

<p><em>Edwin.</em> What is he saying? What has he done with his father?</p>

<p><em>Ang.</em> (<i>perplexed</i>). I can't quite follow this Act&mdash;they talk so
fast.</p>

<p><em>Edwin.</em> And, I say, why on earth have these two turned up? A
lady in complete bridal costume&mdash;wreath, veil, and all&mdash;and a chap
in evening dress. What on earth have <em>they</em> got to do with the
story?</p>

<p><em>Ang.</em> Don't you think, dear, we had better get a book?</p>

<p><em>Edwin</em> (<i>ignoring the suggestion</i>). There's the poor thing dead!</p>

<p><em>Ang.</em> Ah, I understood the last bit quite well. The Italian language
is so much more expressive than our own, isn't it, dear?</p>

<p><em>Edwin.</em> Darling, it is!</p>
